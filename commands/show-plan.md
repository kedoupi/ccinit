## 显示计划

显示当前会话中正在执行或已执行的计划。

### 用法

```bash
/show-plan
```

### 基础示例

```bash
# Check current plan
/show-plan
"Display executing plan"

# When no plan exists
/show-plan
"There is no plan in the current session"
```

### Features

- Detect plans created with exit_plan_mode
- Search for headings containing keywords like implementation plan, implementation details, plan
- Format and display plan contents
- Clearly notify when no plan exists

### 与 Claude 协作

```bash
# Check plan during implementation
"What was I implementing?"
/show-plan

# When executing multiple tasks
"Let me check the current plan again"
/show-plan

# Review after plan execution
"Show me the plan I executed earlier"
/show-plan
```

### Detection Patterns

Based on the format of plans generated by exit_plan_mode, the following patterns are detected:

- Headings starting with `##` (including Plan, Planning, Strategy)
- `### Changes` (Changes)
- `### Implementation Details` (Implementation Details)
- `### Implementation Plan` (Implementation Plan)
- Numbered headings like `### 1.`

### 注意事项

- Only displays plans in the current session (does not include past sessions)
- Displays the latest plan with priority
